// @name           mini findbar matches label
// @author         aminomancer

// @description    creates a miniaturized label for findbar matches and also adds a ctrl+F hotkey to close the findbar if you already have it focused. instead of "1 of 500 matches" this one says "1/500" and floats inside the input box. requires some CSS from my repo obviously. and you'll want to hide the long-winded built-in matches label, naturally. i just added the hotkey because i don't like reaching over to the escape key. this makes ctrl+F more of a findbar toggle than a key that strictly opens the findbar.
// fyi, the hotkey works with ctrl as well as for cmd/meta, like the built-in 'accel' key, but doesn't actually use the accel key pref because it's deprecated. the hotkey works like this: if the findbar isn't open, then ctrl+F opens it. if it is open but the input box is not focused, then ctrl+F focuses it and selects whatever text is in the box. (that's the normal behavior in firefox) and if the findbar is open and the input box is focused, then ctrl+F closes it. also, if you're in 'find as you type' mode, ctrl+F switches to regular find mode. from there, ctrl+F again will close the findbar. (or if you un-focus the findbar in between, it will focus the findbar, and then hitting ctrl+F once more will close it)
// as for the matches indicator, it's written to be as snappy as possible but the built-in indicator logic is a little buggy. we have to cover that weirdness up a bit by checking for unexpected values. it's slower when there are a ton of matched results. the indicator can be styled with the selector .matches-indicator. it's the next sibling of the findbar input box. see uc3.css in this repo for how i styled it. i think there's other findbar-related stuff in some of the other ucX.css files so do a search for 'findbar' or something. it's explained in more detail in the code comments below.

                we use the "empty" attribute here to turn the background on and off. in CSS you just use .matches-indicator[empty] {background: none}. since there's no text in the indicator when it's empty, it doesn't matter if it overlaps with the string you input into the findbar. so we don't need the background while it's empty. we use an attribute instead of removing the bg with javascript, because with CSS we can use a transition. this way the gradient that "masks" the string when it gets too long will smoothly disappear when you change the string to something that returns 0 or 1 results. instead of abruptly disappearing, the far edge of the text just fades back into existence. */
